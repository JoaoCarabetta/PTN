# Empirical Analysis and Modeling of Urban Public Transport Network of São Paulo

Every complex system has an inherent network that represent the structural relationship between its elements,
and a convenient way to interpret this interaction is through the graph theory. 
In this work, the urban public transport network of São Paulo is reinterpreted as a complex network,
abstracting its operational details and focusing on connectivity.
Using the resulted graph, a characterisation of the statistical properties of the network is performed. 
Further, we propose a model that permit to simulate the network vulnerabilities, with the purpose to get a 
topology and structure that increases the robustness. The node degree distribution shows evidence of scale-free
phenomenon, as well as the average length of paths indicates the small-world property. 
These findings support two main characteristics observed in the literature such networks: They have a high rate
of robustness under random failure but are vulnerable to targeted attacks on important nodes or links.

## This code is part of a research in the field of Complex Networks applied to the study of Public transport network
## of São Paulo / Brasil. This is not a finished project, the code is partial and being developed.
